1. What runs JavaScript outside the browser ?
Node. Node provide a runtime environment for JavaScript code.

2. Name 5 things Javascript can do.
i.   Adding interactive behavior to web pages. JavaScript allows users to interact with web pages.
ii.  Game development.
iii. Mobile Apps. You can use JavaScript to create mobile applications. 
iv.  Front-end Web Development. 
v.   Back-end Web Development.

3. When was ECMAScript first released ?
The first version of ECMAScript was released in 1997.

4. How do you log to the console?
    Click and open up Chrome,
    Right Click on empty area and go to inspect,
    This opens up chrome developer tools. There, select the console tab. That is the Javascript console and you can write any valid javascript there. 

5. List the tech fields that use JavaScript, for example FrontEnd.
i.  Mobile app developer.
ii. Front End Web Developer. 
iii. Web Application Developer. 
iv.  JavaScript Developer. 
v.   UX Designer. 
vi.  Web Designer. 
vii. UI Designer. 
viii. Full Stack Developer. 
ix.   DevOps Engineer.
x.    Back End developer.

6. Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category.

    A programming language is “statically-typed” if it follows type checking during compilation. So, every detail about the variables and all the data types must be known before the compiling process.
    In this type of language, once a variable is assigned a type, it can’t be assigned to some other variable of a different type. If this is done, the compiler will raise some errors, and must be fixed. Hence, for a declared variable, the data type is fixed.
    Some examples of statically-typed languages are Java, C, C++, C#, Swift, Scala, Kotlin, Fortran, Pascal, Rust, Go, COBOL, etc.

    while 

    A programming  language is “dynamically typed” if type checking takes place while the program runs (run-time). In this type of language, there is no need to specify the data type of each variable while writing code.
    It means that you can write pretty quickly since you do not have to specify types every time. Some languages do allow you to provide type information but do not require it. Most modern programming languages are dynamically typed. 
    Some examples of dynamically-typed languages are Python, Javascript, Ruby, Perl, PHP, R, Dart, Lua, Objective-C, etc.

    NB:- Type checking is the process of checking and verifying the type of a construct (constant, variable, array, list, object) and its usage context. It helps in minimizing the possibility of type errors in the program.
    Type checking may occur either at compile-time (static checking) or at run-time(dynamic checking).

   7. Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined

        Null in JavaScript means an empty value and is also a primitive type in JavaScript. The variable which has been assigned as null contains no value. This mens that null is a variable that is defined but is missing a value

        While 

        Undefined, on the other hand, means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned. Undefined is a variable that refers to something that doesn't exist, and the variable isn't defined to be anything.
